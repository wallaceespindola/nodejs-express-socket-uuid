# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Installing a Node.js package

For our example, let's say you want to install the express framework. Here's how you'd do it:

1.1. First, initialize a new Node.js project (if you havenâ€™t already) by using:

-> bash:

mkdir my_project
cd my_project
npm init -y

1.2. Now, to install express:

-> bash:

npm install express

2. Using the express package

Create a file named server.js:

javascript

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
Run your server:

-> bash:

node server.js
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser, and you should see "Hello World!".

3. A Good Project Structure

A basic project structure for a Node.js application using Express could look like:


A tip for your .gitignore:

-> bash:

node_modules/
*.log
This ensures your node_modules directory (which can be recreated with npm install from the package.json) and any .log files aren't committed to version control.

As your application grows and evolves, you may want to consider more sophisticated architectures or look into frameworks that provide structure, such as NestJS or AdonisJS. But for starters, the structure above is quite common and scalable.
